The Breadth First Search (BFS) traversal is an algorithm, which is used to visit all of the nodes of a given graph. In this traversal algorithm one node is selected and then all of the adjacent nodes are visited one by one. After completing all of the adjacent vertices, it moves further to check another vertices and checks its adjacent vertices again.

To implement this algorithm, we need to use the Queue data structure. All the adjacent vertices are added into the queue, when all adjacent vertices are completed, one item is removed from the queue and start traversing through that vertex again.

In Graph sometimes, we may get some cycles, so we will use an array to mark when a node is visited already or not.
